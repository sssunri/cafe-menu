## Overview

The Cafe Menu project is a responsive web page developed as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. It aims to help learners practice fundamental HTML and CSS skills by creating a visually appealing menu for a fictional cafe. The project involves structuring HTML elements to represent menu items, such as various coffee and dessert options, along with their prices. It also focuses on applying CSS for layout, typography, and design to ensure the menu is attractive and easy to read.
